WHAT IT IS

When you click "edit all" in the collection view you can edit multiple resources which are in this collection.
Normally you can 
  replace all text
  find and replace
  prepend and apprend text

from a field like Copyright, Title, Keywords, .....

With this plugin enabled you will see if there is already something entered in a certain field and you will get informed if there are different values, no values, or you see the value itself if every field has exactly the same value entered.

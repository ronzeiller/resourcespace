See if there is any information entered in a field - Resource Space Plugin for Multi Edit
by Ronnie Zeiller - www.zeiller.eu
Tested with Version 7.1 and 7.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache2, PHP Version 5.5.9-1ubuntu4.9, MySQL 5.5.43, ExifTool 9.46

WHAT IT IS
==========
When you click "edit all" in the collection view you can edit multiple resources which are in this collection.
Normally you can 
  replace all text
  find and replace
  prepend and apprend text
  remove text
from a field like Copyright, Title, Keywords, .....
But the input field which is shown is always empty, so you do not know if there is already something stored in this field.

With this plugin enabled you will see if there is already something entered in a certain field and you will get informed if there are different values, no values, or you see the value itself if every field has exactly the same value entered.

Language files for English and German are provided.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Simply put all files into the plugins folder and activate it in the Team Center / System setup / Manage Plugins
